Q1 Answer: It will take a minimum of 10.6 seconds to type global aerospace
Q2 Answer: the last project I implemented was developed dynamically/on the fly which means button configuration can be changed easily. 
Disadvantages of this is that code becomes too heavy and. In that case I would use xaml to design UI and loop through Grid child elements
and set button content on the fly. Or create a single customizable button control that can be re-used across other controls.


I have provided link to previous project as well as this one. previous project shows UI work and this project shows solution. I hope this is
everything!
